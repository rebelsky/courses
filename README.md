================
A repository that may eventually hold the Web sites for all of my
courses (starting in Fall 2013).  In essence, this is an experiment 
in branching using git.

Implementation notes
--------------------
I try to have a different directory for each "section" of the site 
(assignments, readings, etc.).  Right now, I have a hack for getting
custom settings for each section - I link the main XSL stylesheets to
the current directory.  That way, we can load some files in the current
directory (e.g., the entities).
